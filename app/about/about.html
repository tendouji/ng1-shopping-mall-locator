    This is my first try on <b>AngularJS</b>(1.5) project. The purpose of this project is to get an idea of the difference between <b>AngularJS</b> and <b>Angular2</b>. Although quite a fair amount of code end up being Google Map API, nonetheless, it gives me a picture of how <b>AngularJS</b>' scope, controller and directives work.

    I started from the seed file provided from the official site and I have to credit these 2 links which I referred to heavily (plus lots of other replies in StackOverflow):

    Both versions provide a framework meant to build Single Page Web Application, via data-binding and dependency injection.

    <b>AngularJS</b> gives me the convenience to quickly dive in and start coding just by opening a new HTML file. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As for <b>Angular2</b>, I am required to spend some time to get used to NodeJS and NPM, and then AngularCLI. They are not hard to learn (since they are well-documented online) but for sure, <b>Angular2</b> is new way of front-end development which requires me to set up an environment to begin. And I would say, the environment is promising. <b>Angular2</b> is very much component-based, and with AngularCLI to kick-start entire project, plus the capability of Typescript and SCSS, development is a wiz.

    I still have more to learn (such is life for a developer), so feel free to check my codes and drop me some comments at <a href="mailto:tendoujir@gmail.com">tendoujir@gmail.com</a>.
