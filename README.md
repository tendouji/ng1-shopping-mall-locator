This is my first try on AngularJS(1.5) project. The purpose of this project is to get an idea of the difference between AngularJS and Angular2. Although quite a fair amount of code end up being Google Map API, nonetheless, it gives me a picture of how AngularJS' scope, controller and directives work. 

I started from the seed file provided from the official site and I have to credit these 2 links which I referred to heavily (plus lots of other replies in StackOverflow):
* https://jsfiddle.net/Xeoncross/k5c2ndyL/
* https://google-developers.appspot.com/maps/documentation/javascript/marker-clustering

## General idea

Both versions provide a framework meant to build Single Page Web Application, via data-binding and dependency injection. 

AngularJS gives me the convenience to quickly dive in and start coding just by opening a new HTML file. 

As for Angular2, I am required to spend some time to get used to NodeJS and NPM, and then AngularCLI. They are not hard to learn (since they are well-documented online) but for sure, Angular2 is new way of front-end development which requires me to set up an environment to begin. And I would say, the environment is promising. Angular2 is very much component-based, and with AngularCLI to kick-start entire project, plus the capability of Typescript and SCSS, development is a wiz.

# Feedbacks

I still have more to learn (such is life for a developer), so feel free to check my codes and drop me some comments at tendoujir@gmail.com
